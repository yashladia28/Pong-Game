  "README.md": "# C++ Pong Game with Raylib\n\nA high-performance, feature-rich recreation of the classic Pong game built entirely in **C++** using the **Raylib** library. This project emphasizes real-time systems, object-oriented design, and physics-based gameplay mechanics.\n\n## 🚀 Features\n\n* **High Performance:** Achieves consistent 60 FPS real-time rendering.\n* **Advanced Physics:** Implemented wall bounce physics, velocity scaling, and spin-based ball reflections for realistic gameplay.\n* **Intelligent AI:** Designed paddle control logic with progressive difficulty curves to keep the challenge engaging.\n* **Persistent Storage:** Integrated high-score tracking using C++ file handling for data retention across sessions.\n* **Game Modes:** Supports both Single-player (vs. AI) and Multiplayer modes with restartable game-over states.\n* **Robust Architecture:** Organized using standard software engineering principles, featuring structured game states, menus, and scoring systems.\n\n## 🛠️ Technical Stack\n\n* **Language:** C++20\n* **Graphics Library:** [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)\n* **Build System:** CMake\n* **Core Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collision Detection, Data Persistence\n\n## 📋 Prerequisites\n\nBefore running this project, ensure you have the following installed:\n\n* A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)\n* CMake (version 3.10 or higher)\n* Raylib library installed on your system\n\n## ⚙️ Installation & Setup\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-raylib-pong.git](https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-raylib-pong.git)\n    cd cpp-raylib-pong\n    ```\n\n2.  **Build the Project:**\n    ```bash\n    mkdir build && cd build\n    cmake ..\n    make\n    ```\n\n3.  **Run the Game:**\n    ```bash\n    ./PongGame\n    ```\n\n## 🎮 Controls\n\n* **Player 1 (Left):** `W` (Up) / `S` (Down)\n* **Player 2 (Right):** `Up Arrow` / `Down Arrow`\n* **Menu Navigation:** Use mouse or keyboard to select game modes.\n\n## 🧠 What I Learned\n\nBuilding this project from scratch served as a deep dive into:\n* Managing a **Game Loop** and real-time state updates.\n* Implementing mathematical models for **collision detection** and **ball physics**.\n* Handling **File I/O** in C++ to maintain persistent high-score data.\n\n---"
